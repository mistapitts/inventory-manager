# Project Rule: Problem Escalation
- Cursor should first attempt to resolve coding issues directly.
- If Cursor cannot solve or the issue repeats, it should consult ChatGPT 5.0 for detailed analysis.
- After ChatGPTâ€™s analysis, Cursor should implement the fixes and refinements.
- This ensures efficient debugging: GPT-5 for problem analysis, Cursor for implementation.
